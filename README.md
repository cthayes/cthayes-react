# cthayes-react

This is the source code http://cthayes.net, built using Facebook's React framework.

## Prereqs

You'll need to install NodeJS and npm. The Git cli is optional, but makes it easy to download the repo.


## Installation
Download the repo or clone it with git:
```
git clone https://github.com/cthayes/cthayes-react.git
```

In a terminal do the following:

```
cd cthayes-react
npm install
npx gulp
open dist/index.html
```

## npm < 5.2?

If you have npm < 5.2 you'll need to install gulp globally:
```
npm install -g gulp
```

Then run it without the npx prefix.
